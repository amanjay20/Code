# ðŸ”¹ Optimal Approach (In-Place, O(1) Space)
# Idea:
# Use the first row and first column as markers. Keep two flags to track if the first row and column originally had any zero.

# Time Complexity: O(m * n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# brute force set matrix zero 
# âœ… Brute Force Idea:

# For every element in the matrix, if itâ€™s zero, mark its row and column to be set to zero later.

# But if we directly set rows and columns to 0 as we find zeros, it will affect future checks.

# So, we use an auxiliary matrix or special marker (e.g., a placeholder value like -1 or any number not in the matrix) to mark cells to be zeroed.

# from typing import List

# def setZeroes(matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
#     n = len(matrix)
#     m = len(matrix[0])
    
#     # Step 1: Create auxiliary matrix to store marks
#     mark = [[False for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    
#     # Step 2: Mark the cells to be zeroed
#     for i in range(n):
#         for j in range(m):
#             if matrix[i][j] == 0:
#                 mark[i][j] = True
    
#     # Step 3: For each marked cell, set entire row and column to zero
#     for i in range(n):
#         for j in range(m):
#             if mark[i][j]:
#                 # Set row to zero
#                 for col in range(m):
#                     matrix[i][col] = 0
#                 # Set column to zero
#                 for row in range(n):
#                     matrix[row][j] = 0
