# # 🔹 1️⃣ Brute Force Approach (O(n²))

# # 👉 For every element in the array, count how many times it appears using a nested loop.
# # If the count is 1 → that’s the single number.

# # def single_number_bruteforce(nums):
# #     for i in nums:
# #         count = 0
# #         for j in nums:
# #             if i == j:
# #                 count += 1
# #         if count == 1:
# #             return i


# # # Example usage
# # nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
# # print("Single Number (Brute):", single_number_bruteforce(nums))


# # ⏱ Time Complexity → O(n²)
# # ✅ Works but inefficient for large arrays.

# 🔹 2️⃣ Better Approach (O(n), O(n) Space – Hash Map)

# 👉 Count frequency of every number using a dictionary, and return the one with frequency 1.

# from collections import Counter

# def single_number_better(nums):
#     freq = Counter(nums)
    
#     for num, count in freq.items():
#         if count == 1:
#             return num


# # Example usage
# nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
# print("Single Number (Better):", single_number_better(nums))


# ⏱ Time Complexity → O(n)
# 🧱 Space Complexity → O(n) (due to the hash map)
