# ðŸ§  Why it works for only positive numbers (or zero)
# The key idea behind sliding window is:

# You only increase the right pointer to expand the window.

# And if the curr_sum > K, you shrink from the left.

# This logic assumes that:

# Adding more elements always increases or keeps the sum same.

# Removing elements always reduces or keeps the sum same.

# This is true for positive numbers or zero only.
